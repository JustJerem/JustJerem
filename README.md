**I'm J√©r√©mie**
, -a French Android Developer at [@World_Health_Organization_Academy](https://www.who.int/about/who-academy) to help doctors and citizens around the world better understand and manage disease. Previously, I worked with [@Finalcad](https://www.finalcad.com/) on their worldwide distributed construction application.  I enjoy mobile apps, but my favorite things are urbanism and hiking (everyone has their own craziness).

My r√©sum√© is available [here in English](https://github.com/JustJerem/JustJerem/blob/master/CV%20GUILLOT%20Freelance%20Android.pdf) - [fr version](https://github.com/JustJerem/JustJerem/blob/master/CV%20GUILLOT%20-%20Freelance%20Android%20-%20Fr.pdf).

#### My Values
- üåü  Expression as an authentic self
- üéó  Safety and trust
- üçè  Beginner's mindset and curiosity
- üôå  Shared understanding and consensus

#### How I Work

My motivation is generated by the impact of the project I'm working on. Having a bachelor's degree in psychology, all the human sciences resonate in me. üë®‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è   I'm more of a guy who likes processes and well-ordered things, like checklists and automations. ü¶æ
