## Jérémie Guillot | @JustJerem

Hi, I'm Jé 👋 -an Android developer at [@World_Health_Organization_Academy](https://www.who.int/about/who-academy) to help doctors and citizens around the world better understand and manage disease. Previously, I worked with [@Finalcad](https://www.finalcad.com/) on their worldwide distributed construction application.  I enjoy video games, but my favorite things are urbanism and hiking (everyone has his own craziness).

## My Values
🌟‏‏‎ ‎Expression as authentic self

🎗‏‏‎ ‎Safety and trust

🍏‏‏‎ ‎Beginner's mindset and curiosity

🙌 ‏‏‎ ‎Shared understanding and consensus

## How I Work

My motivation is generated by the impact of the project I'm working on. Having a bachelor's degree in psychology, all the human sciences resonate in me. 👨‍⚕️   I'm more of a guy who likes processes and well-ordered things, like checklists and automations. 🦾
